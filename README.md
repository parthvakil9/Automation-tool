# Automation-tool

- This tool is currently made to verify major vulnerabilities found by Scanners on the basis of version or other common factors.
- In order to use the script, use the command:
```
python Automation-tool.py -f File-path -s POC-output.txt
```
- The File-path here is the Path of the CSV file given by the scanner and the POC-output is the output file which saves the POC for future reference.
